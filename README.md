This repository contains code used in my blog posts on SOLID principles.

File structure:

- `functions.py`: SOLID-friendly code
- Use `main.py` to execute functions from `functions.py`
- `wrong.py`: code designed against SOLID principles.
- `tests.py` contains unit tests for functions from `functions.py`
